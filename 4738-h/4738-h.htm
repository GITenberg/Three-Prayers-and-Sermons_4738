373</span>THREE PRAYERS<br />
<span class="GutSmall">USED BY THE DEAN FOR STELLA</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN HER LAST SICKNESS, 1727.</span></h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Almighty</span> and most gracious Lord
God, extend, we beseech Thee, Thy pity and compassion toward this
Thy languishing servant; teach her to place her hope and
confidence entirely in Thee; give her a true sense of the
emptiness and vanity of all earthly things; make her truly
sensible of all the infirmities of her life past, and grant to
her such a true sincere repentance as is not to be repented
of.&nbsp; Preserve her, O Lord, in a sound mind and understanding
during this Thy visitation; keep her from both the sad extremes
of presumption and despair.&nbsp; If Thou shalt please to restore
her to her former health, give her grace to be ever mindful of
that mercy, and to keep those good resolutions she now makes in
her sickness, so that no length of time nor prosperity may entice
her to forget them.&nbsp; Let no thought of her misfortunes
distract her mind, and prevent the means toward her recovery, or
disturb her in her preparations for a better life.&nbsp; We
beseech thee also, O Lord, of Thy infinite goodness, to remember
the good actions of this Thy servant; that the naked she hath
clothed, the hungry she hath fed, the sick and the fatherless
whom she hath relieved, may be reckoned according to Thy gracious
promise, as if they had been done unto Thee.&nbsp; Hearken, O
Lord, to the prayers offered up by the friends of this Thy
servant in her behalf, and especially those now made by us unto
thee.&nbsp; Give Thy blessing to those endeavours used for her
recovery; but take from her all violent desire either of life or
death, further than with resignation to Thy holy will.&nbsp; And
now, O Lord, we implore Thy gracious favour toward us here met
together.&nbsp; Grant that the sense of this Thy servant&rsquo;s
weakness may add strength to our faith; that we, considering the
infirmities of our nature and the uncertainty of life, may by
this example be drawn to repentance before it shall please Thee
to visit us in like manner.&nbsp; Accept these prayers, we
beseech Thee, for the sake of Thy dear Son Jesus Christ, our
Lord, who, with Thee and the Holy Ghost, liveth and reigneth,
ever one God, world without end.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<h3>II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WRITTEN OCTOBER 17, 1727.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> merciful Father, accept our
humblest prayers in behalf of this Thy languishing servant;
forgive the sins, the frailties, and infirmities of her life
past.&nbsp; Accept the good deeds she hath done in such a manner
that, at whatever time Thou shalt please to call her, she may be
received into everlasting habitations.&nbsp; Give her grace to
continue sincerely thankful to Thee for the many favours Thou
hast bestowed upon her, the ability and inclination and practice
to do good, and those virtues which have procured the esteem and
love of her friends and a most unspotted name in the world.&nbsp;
O God, Thou dispensest Thy blessings and Thy punishments as it
becometh infinite justice and mercy; and since it was Thy
pleasure to afflict her with a long, constant, weakly state of
health, make her truly sensible that it was for very wise ends,
and was largely made up to her in other blessings more valuable
and less common.&nbsp; Continue to her, O Lord, that firmness and
constancy of mind wherewith Thou hast most graciously endowed
her, together with that contempt of worldly things and vanities
that she has shown in the whole conduct of her life.&nbsp; O
All-powerful Being, the least motion of whose will can create or
destroy a world, pity us, the mournful friends of Thy distressed
servant, who sink under the weight of her present condition, and
the fear of losing the most valuable of our friends.&nbsp;
Restore her to us, O Lord, if it be Thy gracious will, or inspire
us with constancy and resignation to support ourselves under so
heavy an affliction.&nbsp; Restore her, O Lord, for the sake of
those poor who, by losing her, will be desolate, and those sick
who will not only want her bounty, but her care and tending; or
else, in Thy mercy, raise up some other in her place with equal
disposition and better abilities.&nbsp; Lessen, O Lord, we
beseech Thee, her bodily pains, or give her a double strength of
mind to support them.&nbsp; And if Thou wilt soon take her to
Thyself, turn our thoughts rather upon that felicity which we
hope she shall enjoy, than upon that unspeakable loss we shall
endure.&nbsp; Let her memory be ever dear unto us, and the
example of her many virtues, as far as human infirmity will
admit, our constant imitation.&nbsp; Accept, O Lord, these
prayers, poured from the very bottom of our hearts, in Thy mercy,
and for the merits of our blessed Saviour.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<h3>III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WRITTEN NOVEMBER 6, 1727.</span></h3>
<p>O <span class="smcap">merciful</span> Father, who never
afflictest Thy children but for their own good, and with justice,
over which Thy mercy always prevaileth, either to turn them to
repentance, or to punish them in the present life in order to
reward them in a better; take pity, we beseech Thee, upon this
Thy poor afflicted servant, languishing so long and so grievously
under the weight of Thy hand.&nbsp; Give her strength, O Lord, to
support her weakness, and patience to endure her pains without
repining at Thy correction.&nbsp; Forgive every rash and
inconsiderate expression which her anguish may at any time force
from her tongue, while her heart continueth in an entire
submission to Thy will.&nbsp; Suppress in her, O Lord, all eager
desires of life, and lessen her fears of death by inspiring into
her an humble yet assured hope of Thy mercy.&nbsp; Give her a
sincere repentance for all her transgressions and omissions, and
a firm resolution to pass the remainder of her life in
endeavouring to her utmost to observe all Thy precepts.&nbsp; We
beseech Thee likewise to compose her thoughts, and preserve to
her the use of her memory and reason during the course of her
sickness.&nbsp; Give her a true conception of the vanity, folly,
and insignificance of all human things, and strengthen her so as
to beget in her a sincere love of Thee in the midst of her
sufferings.&nbsp; Accept and impute all her good deeds, and
forgive her all those offences against Thee which she hath
sincerely repented of or through the frailty of memory hath
forgot.&nbsp; And now, O Lord, we turn to Thee in behalf of
ourselves and the rest of her sorrowful friends.&nbsp; Let not
our grief afflict her mind, and thereby have an ill effect on her
present distemper.&nbsp; Forgive the sorrow and weakness of those
among us who sink under the grief and terror of losing so dear
and useful a friend.&nbsp; Accept and pardon our most earnest
prayers and wishes for her longer continuance in this evil world,
to do what Thou art pleased to call Thy service, and is only her
bounden duty, that she may be still a comfort to us and to all
others who will want the benefit of her conversation, her advice,
her good offices, or her charity.&nbsp; And since Thou hast
promised that where two or three are gathered together in Thy
name Thou wilt be in the midst of them to grant their request, O
gracious Lord, grant to us who are here met in Thy name that
those requests, which in the utmost sincerity and earnestness of
our hearts we have now made in behalf of this Thy distressed
servant and of ourselves, may effectually be answered, through
the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

MUTUAL SUBJECTION. <a name="citation377"></a><a
href="#footnote377" class="citation">[377]</a><br />
<span class="GutSmall">(FIRST PRINTED IN 1744.)</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Yea, all of you
be subject one to another.&rdquo;&mdash;I <i>Peter</i> v. 5</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Apostle having, in many parts
of this Epistle, given directions to Christians concerning the
duty of subjection or obedience to superiors, in the several
instances of the subject to the prince, the child to his parent,
the servant to his master, the wife to her husband, and the
younger to the elder, doth here, in the words of my text, sum up
the whole by advancing a point of doctrine, which at first may
appear a little extraordinary.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yea, all of
you,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;be subject one to
another.&rdquo;&nbsp; For it should seem that two persons cannot
properly be said to be subject to each other, and that subjection
is only due from inferiors to those above them; yet St. Paul hath
several passages to the same purpose.&nbsp; For he exhorts the
Romans &ldquo;in honour to prefer one another;&rdquo; and the
Philippians, &ldquo;that in lowliness of mind they should each
esteem other better than themselves;&rdquo; and the Ephesians,
&ldquo;that they should submit themselves one to another in the
fear of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we find these two great
Apostles recommending to all Christians this duty of mutual
subjection.&nbsp; For we may observe, by St. Peter, that having
mentioned the several relations which men bear to each other, as
governor and subject, master and servant, and the rest which I
have already repeated, he makes no exception, but sums up the
whole with commanding &ldquo;all to be subject one to
another.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whence we may conclude that this subjection
due from all men to all men is something more than the compliment
of course, when our betters are pleased to tell us they are our
humble servants, but understand us to be their slaves.</p>
<p>I know very well that some of those who explain this text
apply it to humility, to the duties of charity, to private
exhortations, and to bearing with each other&rsquo;s infirmities;
and it is probable the Apostle may have had a regard to all
these.&nbsp; But, however, many learned men agree that there is
something more understood, and so the words in their plain
natural meaning must import, as you will observe yourselves if
you read them with the beginning of the verse, which is thus:
&ldquo;Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder;
yea, all of you be subject one to another.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that,
upon the whole, there must be some kind of subjection due from
every man to every man, which cannot be made void by any power,
pre-eminence, or authority whatsoever.&nbsp; Now what sort of
subjection this is, and how it ought to be paid, shall be the
subject of my present discourse.</p>
<p>As God hath contrived all the works of Nature to be useful,
and in some manner a support to each other, by which the whole
frame of the world, under His providence, is preserved and kept
up, so among mankind our particular stations are appointed to
each of us by God Almighty, wherein we are obliged to act as far
as our power reacheth toward the good of the whole
community.&nbsp; And he who doth not perform that part assigned
him towards advancing the benefit of the whole, in proportion to
his opportunities and abilities, is not only a useless, but a
very mischievous member of the public; because he takes his share
of the profit, and yet leaves his share of the burden to be borne
by others, which is the true principal cause of most miseries and
misfortunes in life.&nbsp; For a wise man who does not assist
with his counsels, a great man with his protection, a rich man
with his bounty and charity, and a poor man with his labour, are
perfect nuisances in a commonwealth.&nbsp; Neither is any
condition of life more honourable in the sight of God than
another; otherwise He would be a respecter of persons, which He
assures us He is not; for He hath proposed the same salvation to
all men, and hath only placed them in different ways or stations
to work it out.&nbsp; Princes are born with no more advantages of
strength or wisdom than other men, and, by an unhappy education,
are usually more defective in both than thousands of their
subjects.&nbsp; They depend for every necessary of life upon the
meanest of their people; besides, obedience and subjection were
never enjoined by God to humour the passions, lusts, and vanities
of those who demand them from us; but we are commanded to obey
our governors, because disobedience would breed seditions in the
state.&nbsp; Thus servants are directed to obey their masters,
children their parents, and wives their husbands, not from any
respect of persons in God, but because otherwise there would be
nothing but confusion in private families.&nbsp; This matter will
be clearly explained by considering the comparison which St. Paul
makes between the Church of Christ and the body of man; for the
same resemblance will hold not only to families and kingdoms, but
to the whole corporation of mankind.&nbsp; &ldquo;The eye,&rdquo;
saith he, &ldquo;cannot say unto the hand, &lsquo;I have no need
of thee;&rsquo; nor again the hand to the foot, &lsquo;I have no
need of thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nay, much more those members of the
body which seem to be more feeble are necessary; and whether one
member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be
honoured, all the members rejoice with it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The case
is directly the same among mankind.&nbsp; The prince cannot say
to the merchant, &ldquo;I have no need of thee,&rdquo; nor the
merchant to the labourer, &ldquo;I have no need of
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, much more those members which seem to be
more feeble are necessary; for the poor are generally more
necessary members of the commonwealth than the rich; which
clearly shows that God never intended such possessions for the
sake and service of those to whom He lends them, but because he
hath assigned every man his particular station to be useful in
life, and this for the reason given by the Apostle, &ldquo;that
there may be no schism in the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From hence may partly be gathered the nature of that
subjection which we all owe to one another.&nbsp; God Almighty
hath been pleased to put us into an imperfect state, where we
have perpetual occasion of each other&rsquo;s assistance.&nbsp;
There is none so low as not to be in a capacity of assisting the
highest, nor so high as not to want the assistance of the
lowest.</p>
<p>It plainly appears, from what hath been said, that no one
human creature is more worthy than another in the sight of God,
further than according to the goodness or holiness of their
lives; and that power, wealth, and the like outward advantages,
are so far from being the marks of God&rsquo;s approving or
preferring those on whom they are bestowed, that, on the
contrary, He is pleased to suffer them to be almost engrossed by
those who have least title to His favour.&nbsp; Now, according to
this equality wherein God hath placed all mankind with relation
to Himself, you will observe that in all the relations between
man and man there is a mutual dependence, whereby the one cannot
subsist without the other.&nbsp; Thus no man can be a prince
without subjects, nor a master without servants, nor a father
without children.&nbsp; And this both explains and confirms the
doctrine of the text; for where there is a mutual dependence
there must be a mutual duty, and consequently a mutual
subjection.&nbsp; For instance, the subject must obey his prince,
because God commands it, human laws require it, and the safety of
the public makes it necessary; for the same reasons we must obey
all that are in authority, and submit ourselves not only to the
good and gentle, but also to the froward, whether they rule
according to our liking or not.&nbsp; On the other side, in those
countries that pretend to freedom, princes are subject to those
laws which their people have chosen; they are bound to protect
their subjects in liberty, property, and religion, to receive
their petitions and redress their grievances, so that the best
prince is, in the opinion of wise men, only the greatest servant
of the nation&mdash;not only a servant to the public in general,
but in some sort to every man in it.&nbsp; In the like manner a
servant owes obedience, and diligence, and faithfulness to his
master, from whom, at the same time, he hath a just demand for
protection, and maintenance, and gentle treatment.&nbsp; Nay,
even the poor beggar hath a just demand of an alms from the rich
man, who is guilty of fraud, injustice, and oppression if he does
not afford relief according to his abilities.</p>
<p>But this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more
necessary than in the common conversations of life, for without
it there could be no society among men.&nbsp; If the learned
would not sometimes submit to the ignorant, the wise to the
simple, the gentle to the froward, the old to the weaknesses of
the young, there would be nothing but everlasting variance in the
world.&nbsp; This our Saviour Himself confirmed by His own
example; for He appeared in the form of a servant and washed His
disciples&rsquo; feet, adding those memorable words, &ldquo;Ye
call me Lord and Master, and ye say well, for so I am.&nbsp; If I
then, your Lord and Master, wash your feet, how much more ought
ye to wash one another&rsquo;s feet?&rdquo;&nbsp; Under which
expression of washing the feet is included all that subjection,
assistance, love, and duty, which every good Christian ought to
pay his brother, in whatever station God hath placed him.&nbsp;
For the greatest prince and the meanest slave are not, by
infinite degrees, so distant as our Saviour and those disciples,
whose feet He vouchsafed to wash.</p>
<p>And although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one
another may seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind,
and may therefore be hard to be digested by those who value
themselves upon their greatness or their wealth, yet it is really
no more than what most men practise upon other occasions.&nbsp;
For if our neighbour, who is our inferior, comes to see us, we
rise to receive him; we place him above us, and respect him as if
he were better than ourselves; and this is thought both decent
and necessary, and is usually called good manners.&nbsp; Now the
duty required by the Apostle is only that we should enlarge our
minds, and that what we thus practise in the common course of
life we should imitate in all our actions and proceedings
whatsoever; since our Saviour tells us that every man is our
neighbour, and since we are so ready, in point of civility, to
yield to others in our own houses, where only we have any title
to govern.</p>
<p>Having thus shown you what sort of subjection it is which all
men owe one another, and in what manner it ought to be paid, I
shall now draw some observations from what hath been said.</p>
<p>And first, a thorough practice of this duty of subjecting
ourselves to the wants and infirmities of each other would
utterly extinguish in us the vice of pride.</p>
<p>For if God has pleased to intrust me with a talent, not for my
own sake, but for the service of others, and at the same time
hath left me full of wants and necessities which others must
supply, I can then have no cause to set any extraordinary value
upon myself, or to despise my brother because he hath not the
same talents which were lent to me.&nbsp; His being may probably
be as useful to the public as mine; and therefore, by the rules
of right reason, I am in no sort preferable to him.</p>
<p>Secondly, It is very manifest, from what has been said, that
no man ought to look upon the advantages of life, such as riches,
honour, power, and the like, as his property, but merely as a
trust which God hath deposited with him to be employed for the
use of his brethren, and God will certainly punish the breach of
that trust, though the laws of man will not, or rather indeed
cannot; because the trust was conferred only by God, who has not
left it to any power on earth to decide infallibly whether a man
makes a good use of his talents or not, or to punish him where he
fails.&nbsp; And therefore God seems to have more particularly
taken this matter into His own hands, and will most certainly
reward or punish us in proportion to our good or ill performance
in it.&nbsp; Now, although the advantages which one possesseth
more than another may, in some sense, be called his property with
respect to other men, yet with respect to God they are, as I
said, only a trust, which will plainly appear from hence: if a
man does not use those advantages to the good of the public or
the benefit of his neighbour, it is certain he doth not deserve
them, and consequently that God never intended them for a
blessing to him; and on the other side, whoever does employ his
talents as he ought will find, by his own experience, that they
were chiefly lent him for the service of others, for to the
service of others he will certainly employ them.</p>
<p>Thirdly, If we could all be brought to practise this duty of
subjecting ourselves to each other, it would very much contribute
to the general happiness of mankind, for this would root out envy
and malice from the heart of man; because you cannot envy your
neighbour&rsquo;s strength if he make use of it to defend your
life or carry your burden; you cannot envy his wisdom if he gives
you good counsel; nor his riches if he supplies your wants; nor
his greatness if he employs it to your protection.&nbsp; The
miseries of life are not properly owing to the unequal
distribution of things, but God Almighty, the great King of
heaven, is treated like the kings of the earth, who, although
perhaps intending well themselves, have often most abominable
ministers and stewards, and those generally the vilest to whom
they intrust the most talents.&nbsp; But here is the difference,
that the princes of this world see by other men&rsquo;s eyes, but
God sees all things; and therefore, whenever He permits His
blessings to be dealt among those who are unworthy, we may
certainly conclude that He intends them only as a punishment to
an evil world, as well as to the owners.&nbsp; It were well if
those would consider this, whose riches serve them only as a spur
to avarice or as an instrument of their lusts; whose wisdom is
only of this world, to put false colours upon things, to call
good evil and evil good against the conviction of their own
consciences; and lastly, who employ their power and favour in
acts of oppression or injustice, in misrepresenting persons and
things, or in countenancing the wicked to the ruin of the
innocent.</p>
<p>Fourthly, The practice of this duty of being subject to one
another would make us rest contented in the several stations of
life wherein God hath thought fit to place us, because it would,
in the best and easiest manner, bring us back, as it were, to
that early state of the Gospel when Christians had all things in
common.&nbsp; For if the poor found the rich disposed to supply
their want, if the ignorant found the wise ready to instruct and
direct them, or if the weak might always find protection from the
mighty, they could none of them, with the least pretence of
justice, lament their own condition.</p>
<p>From all that hath been hitherto said it appears that great
abilities of any sort, when they are employed as God directs, do
but make the owners of them greater and more painful servants to
their neighbour and the public.&nbsp; However, we are by no means
to conclude from hence that they are not really blessings, when
they are in the hands of good men.&nbsp; For, first, what can be
a greater honour than to be chosen one of the stewards and
dispensers of God&rsquo;s bounty to mankind?&nbsp; What is there
that can give a generous spirit more pleasure and complacency of
mind than to consider that he is an instrument of doing much
good; that great numbers owe to him, under God, their
subsistence, their safety, their health, and the good conduct of
their lives?&nbsp; The wickedest man upon earth takes a pleasure
in doing good to those he loves; and therefore surely a good
Christian, who obeys our Saviour&rsquo;s commands of loving all
men, cannot but take delight in doing good even to his
enemies.&nbsp; God, who gives all things to all men, can receive
nothing from any; and those among men who do the most good and
receive the fewest returns do most resemble the Creator; for
which reason St. Paul delivers it as a saying of our Saviour,
that &ldquo;it is more blessed to give than receive.&rdquo;&nbsp;
By this rule, what must become of those things which the world
values as the greatest blessings&mdash;riches, power, and the
like&mdash;when our Saviour plainly determines that the best way
to make them blessings is to part with them?&nbsp; Therefore,
although the advantages which one man hath over another may be
called blessings, yet they are by no means so in the sense the
world usually understands.&nbsp; Thus, for example, great riches
are no blessings in themselves, because the poor man, with the
common necessaries of life, enjoys more health and has fewer
cares without them.&nbsp; How then do they become
blessings?&nbsp; No otherwise than by being employed in feeding
the hungry, clothing the naked, rewarding worthy men, and, in
short, doing acts of charity and generosity.&nbsp; Thus,
likewise, power is no blessing in itself, because private men
bear less envy, and trouble, and anguish without it.&nbsp; But
when it is employed to protect the innocent, to relieve the
oppressed, and to punish the oppressor, then it becomes a great
blessing.</p>
<p>And so, lastly, even great wisdom is, in the opinion of
Solomon, not a blessing in itself; for &ldquo;in much wisdom is
much sorrow;&rdquo; and men of common understanding, if they
serve God and mind their callings, make fewer mistakes in the
conduct of life than those who have better heads.&nbsp; And yet
wisdom is a mighty blessing when it is applied to good purposes,
to instruct the ignorant, to be a faithful counsellor either in
public or private, to be a director to youth, and to many other
ends needless here to mention.</p>
<p>To conclude: God sent us into the world to obey His commands,
by doing as much good as our abilities will reach, and as little
evil as our many infirmities will permit.&nbsp; Some He hath only
trusted with one talent, some with five, and some with ten.&nbsp;
No man is without his talent; and he that is faithful or
negligent in a little shall be rewarded or punished, as well as
he that hath been so in a great deal.</p>
<p>Consider what hath been said, &amp;c.</p>
<h2><a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 385</span>ON
SLEEPING IN CHURCH.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And there sat in the window a certain young
man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep; and while
Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down
from the third loft, and was taken up
dead.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Acts</i> xx. 9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> chosen these words with
design, if possible, to disturb some part in this audience of
half an hour&rsquo;s sleep, for the convenience and exercise
whereof this place, at this season of the day, is very much
celebrated.</p>
<p>There is indeed one mortal disadvantage to which all preaching
is subject, that those who, by the wickedness of their lives,
stand in greatest need, have usually the smallest share; for
either they are absent upon the account of idleness, or spleen,
or hatred to religion, or in order to doze away the intemperance
of the week; or, if they do come, they are sure to employ their
minds rather any other way than regarding or attending to the
business of the place.</p>
<p>The accident which happened to this young man in the text hath
not been sufficient to discourage his successors; but because the
preachers now in the world, however they may exceed St. Paul in
the art of setting men to sleep, do extremely fall short of him
in the working of miracles, therefore men are become so cautious
as, to choose more safe and convenient stations and postures for
taking their repose without hazard of their persons, and upon the
whole matter choose rather to trust their destruction to a
miracle than their safety.&nbsp; However, this being not the only
way by which the lukewarm Christians and scorners of the age
discover their neglect and contempt of preaching, I shall enter
expressly into consideration of this matter, and order my
discourse in the following method:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>First</i>, I shall produce several
instances to show the great neglect of preaching now among
us.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Secondly</i>, I shall reckon up some of
the usual quarrels men have against preaching.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Thirdly</i>, I shall get forth the great
evil of this neglect and contempt of preaching, and discover the
real causes whence it proceedeth.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Lastly</i>, I shall offer some remedies
against this great and spreading evil.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, I shall produce certain instances to show the
great neglect of preaching now among us.</p>
<p>These may be reduced under two heads.&nbsp; First, men&rsquo;s
absence from the service of the church; and secondly, their
misbehaviour when they are here.</p>
<p>The first instance of men&rsquo;s neglect is in their frequent
absence from the church.</p>
<p>There is no excuse so trivial that will not pass upon some
men&rsquo;s consciences to excuse their attendance at the public
worship of God.&nbsp; Some are so unfortunate as to be always
indisposed on the Lord&rsquo;s day, and think nothing so
unwholesome as the air of a church.&nbsp; Others have their
affairs so oddly contrived as to be always unluckily prevented by
business.&nbsp; With some it is a great mark of wit and deep
understanding to stay at home on Sundays.&nbsp; Others again
discover strange fits of laziness, that seize them particularly
on that day, and confine them to their beds.&nbsp; Others are
absent out of mere contempt of religion.&nbsp; And lastly, there
are not a few who look upon it as a day of rest, and therefore
claim the privilege of their cattle, to keep the Sabbath by
eating, drinking, and sleeping, after the toil and labour of the
week.&nbsp; Now in all this, the worst circumstance is that these
persons are such whose company is most required, and who stand
most in need of a physician.</p>
<p>Secondly, Men&rsquo;s great neglect and contempt of preaching
appear by their misbehaviour when at church.</p>
<p>If the audience were to be ranked under several heads,
according to their behaviour when the Word of God is delivered,
how small a number would appear of those who receive it as they
ought!&nbsp; How much of the seed then sown would be found to
fall by the wayside, upon stony ground, or among thorns! and how
little good ground would there be to take it!&nbsp; A preacher
cannot look round from the pulpit without observing that some are
in a perpetual whisper, and by their air and gesture give
occasion to suspect that they are in those very minutes defaming
their neighbour.&nbsp; Others have their eyes and imagination
constantly engaged in such a circle of objects, perhaps to
gratify the most unwarrantable desires, that they never once
attend to the business of the place; the sound of the
preacher&rsquo;s words do not so much as once interrupt
them.&nbsp; Some have their minds wandering among idle, worldly,
or vicious thoughts; some lie at catch to ridicule whatever they
hear, and with much wit and humour, provide a stock of laughter
by furnishing themselves from the pulpit.&nbsp; But of all
misbehaviour, none is comparable to that of those who come here
to sleep.&nbsp; Opium is not so stupefying to many persons as an
afternoon sermon.&nbsp; Perpetual custom hath so brought it about
that the words of whatever preacher become only a sort of uniform
sound at a distance, than which nothing is more effectual to lull
the senses.&nbsp; For that it is the very sound of the sermon
which bindeth up their faculties is manifest from hence, because
they all awake so very regularly as soon as it ceaseth, and with
much devotion receive the blessing, dozed and besotted with
indecencies I am ashamed to repeat.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I proceed, <i>secondly</i>, to reckon up some of the usual
quarrels men have against preaching, and to show the
unreasonableness of them.</p>
<p>Such unwarrantable behaviour as I have described among
Christians in the house of God in a solemn assembly, while their
faith and duty are explained and delivered, have put those who
are guilty upon inventing some excuses to extenuate their fault;
this they do by turning the blame either upon the particular
preacher or upon preaching in general.&nbsp; First, they object
against the particular preacher: his manner, his delivery, his
voice, are disagreeable; his style and expression are flat and
slow, sometimes improper and absurd; the matter is heavy,
trivial, and insipid, sometimes despicable and perfectly
ridiculous; or else, on the other side, he runs up into
unintelligible speculation, empty notions, and abstracted
flights, all clad in words above usual understandings.</p>
<p>Secondly, They object against preaching in general.&nbsp; It
is a perfect road of talk; they know already whatever can be
said; they have heard the same a hundred times over.&nbsp; They
quarrel that preachers do not relieve an old beaten subject with
wit and invention, and that now the art is lost of moving
men&rsquo;s passions, so common among the ancient orators of
Greece and Rome.&nbsp; These and the like objections are
frequently in the mouths of men who despise the foolishness of
preaching.&nbsp; But let us examine the reasonableness of
them.</p>
<p>The doctrine delivered by all preachers is the same: &ldquo;So
we preach, and so ye believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the manner of
delivering is suited to the skill and abilities of each, which
differ in preachers just as in the rest of mankind.&nbsp;
However, in personal dislikes of a particular preacher, are these
men sure they are always in the right?&nbsp; Do they consider how
mixed a thing is every audience, whose taste and judgment differ,
perhaps, every day, not only from each other, but
themselves?&nbsp; And how to calculate a discourse that shall
exactly suit them all, is beyond the force and reach of human
reason, knowledge, or invention.&nbsp; Wit and eloquence are
shining qualities that God hath imparted in great degrees to very
few, nor any more to be expected in the generality of any rank
among men than riches and honour.&nbsp; But further, if preaching
in general be all old and beaten, and that they are already so
well acquainted with it, more shame and guilt to them who so
little edify by it!&nbsp; But these men, whose ears are so
delicate as not to endure a plain discourse of religion, who
expect a constant supply of wit and eloquence on a subject
handled so many thousand times, what will they say when we turn
the objection upon themselves, who, with all the rude and profane
liberty of discourse they take upon so many thousand subjects,
are so dull as to furnish nothing but tedious repetitions, and
little paltry, nauseous commonplaces, so vulgar, so worn, or so
obvious, as, upon any other occasion but that of advancing vice,
would be hooted off the stage?&nbsp; Nor, lastly, are preachers
justly blamed for neglecting human oratory to move the passions,
which is not the business of a Christian orator, whose office it
is only to work upon faith and reason.&nbsp; All other eloquence
hath been a perfect cheat, to stir up men&rsquo;s passions
against truth and justice for the service of a faction, to put
false colours upon things, and, by an amusement of agreeable
words, make the worst reason appear to be the better.&nbsp; This
is certainly not to be allowed in Christian eloquence, and
therefore St. Paul took quite the other course.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;came not with the excellency of words, or enticing speech
of men&rsquo;s wisdom, but in plain evidence of the Spirit and
power.&rdquo;&nbsp; And perhaps it was for that reason the young
man Eutychus, used to the Grecian eloquence, grew tired and fell
so fast asleep.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I go on, thirdly, to set forth the great evil of this neglect
and scorn of preaching, and to discover the real causes whence it
proceedeth.</p>
<p>I think it is obvious that this neglect of preaching hath very
much occasioned the great decay of religion among us.&nbsp; To
this may be imputed no small part of that contempt some men
bestow on the clergy, for whoever talketh without being regarded
is sure to be despised.&nbsp; To this we owe in a great measure
the spreading of atheism and infidelity among us, for religion,
like all other things, is soonest put out of countenance by being
ridiculed.&nbsp; The scorn of preaching might perhaps have been
at first introduced by men of nice ears and refined taste, but it
is now become a spreading evil through all degrees and both
sexes; for, since sleeping, talking, and laughing are qualities
sufficient to furnish out a critic, the meanest and most ignorant
have set up a title, and succeeded in it as well as their
betters.&nbsp; Thus are the last efforts of reforming mankind
rendered wholly useless.&nbsp; &ldquo;How shall they hear,&rdquo;
saith the Apostle, &ldquo;without a preacher?&rdquo;&nbsp; But if
they have a preacher, and make it a point of wit or breeding not
to hear him, what remedy is left?&nbsp; To this neglect of
preaching we may also entirely impute that gross ignorance among
us in the very principles of religion, which it is amazing to
find in persons who very much value their own knowledge and
understanding in other things; yet it is a visible, inexcusable
ignorance, even in the meanest among us, considering the many
advantages they have of learning their duty.&nbsp; And it hath
been the great encouragement to all manner of vice; for in vain
we preach down sin to a people &ldquo;whose hearts are waxed
gross, whose ears are dull of hearing and whose eyes are
closed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore Christ Himself in His discourses
frequently rouseth up the attention of the multitude, and of His
disciples themselves, with this expression, &ldquo;He that hath
ears to hear let him hear.&rdquo;&nbsp; But among all neglects of
preaching, none is so fatal as that of sleeping in the house of
God.&nbsp; A scorner may listen to truth and reason, and in time
grow serious; an unbeliever may feel the pangs of a guilty
conscience; one whose thoughts or eyes wander among other objects
may, by a lucky word, be called back to attention; but the
sleeper shuts up all avenues to his soul; he is &ldquo;like the
deaf adder, that hearkeneth not to the voice of the charmer,
charm he never so wisely;&rdquo; and we may preach with as good
success to the grave that is under his feet.</p>
<p>But the great evil of this neglect will further yet appear
from considering the real causes whence it proceedeth, whereof
the first I take to be an evil conscience.&nbsp; Many men come to
church to save or gain a reputation, or because they will not be
singular, but comply with an established custom, yet all the
while they are loaded with the guilt of old rooted sins.&nbsp;
These men can expect to hear of nothing but terrors and
threatenings, their sins laid open in true colours, and eternal
misery the reward of them; therefore, no wonder they stop their
care and divert their thoughts, and seek any amusement rather
than stir the hell within them.</p>
<p>Another cause of this neglect is a heart set upon worldly
things.&nbsp; Men whose minds are much enslaved to earthly
affairs all the week cannot disengage or break the chain of their
thoughts so suddenly as to apply to a discourse that is wholly
foreign to what they have most at heart.&nbsp; Tell a usurer of
charity, and mercy, and restitution&mdash;you talk to the deaf;
his heart and soul, with all his senses, are got among his bags,
or he is gravely asleep and dreaming of a mortgage.&nbsp; Tell a
man of business, that the cares of the world choke the good seed;
that we must not encumber ourselves with much serving; that the
salvation of his soul is the one thing necessary; you see,
indeed, the shape of a man before you, but his faculties are all
gone off among clients and papers, thinking how to defend a bad
cause or find flaws in a good one; or he weareth out the time in
drowsy nods.</p>
<p>A third cause of the great neglect and scorn of preaching
ariseth from the practice of men who set up to decry and
disparage religion; these, being zealous to promote infidelity
and vice, learn a rote of buffoonery that serveth all occasions,
and refutes the strongest arguments for piety and good
manners.&nbsp; These have a set of ridicule calculated for all
sermons and all preachers, and can be extremely witty as often as
they please upon the same fund.</p>
<p>Let me now, in the last place, offer some remedies against
this great evil.</p>
<p>It will be one remedy against the contempt of preaching
rightly to consider the end for which it was designed.&nbsp;
There are many who place abundance of merit in going to church,
although it be with no other prospect but that of being well
entertained, wherein if they happen to fail, they return wholly
disappointed.&nbsp; Hence it is become an impertinent vein among
people of all sorts to hunt after what they call a good sermon,
as if it were a matter of pastime and diversion.&nbsp; Our
business, alas! is quite another thing; either to learn, or at
least be reminded of, our duty; to apply the doctrines delivered,
compare the rules we hear with our lives and actions, and find
wherein we have transgressed.&nbsp; These are the dispositions
men should bring into the house of God, and then they will be
little concerned about the preacher&rsquo;s wit or eloquence, nor
be curious to inquire out his faults and infirmities, but
consider how to correct their own.</p>
<p>Another remedy against the contempt of preaching is that men
would consider whether it be not reasonable to give more
allowance for the different abilities of preachers than they
usually do.&nbsp; Refinements of style and flights of wit, as
they are not properly the business of any preacher, so they
cannot possibly be the talents of all.&nbsp; In most other
discourses, men are satisfied with sober sense and plain reason;
and, as understandings usually go, even that is not
over-frequent.&nbsp; Then why they should be so over-nice in
expectation of eloquence, where it is neither necessary nor
convenient, is hard to imagine.</p>
<p>Lastly, The scorners of preaching would do well to consider
that this talent of ridicule they value so much is a perfection
very easily acquired, and applied to all things whatsoever;
neither is anything at all the worse because it is capable of
being perverted to burlesque; perhaps it may be the more perfect
upon that score, since we know the most celebrated pieces have
been thus treated with greatest success.&nbsp; It is in any
man&rsquo;s power to suppose a fool&rsquo;s-cap on the wisest
head, and then laugh at his own supposition.&nbsp; I think there
are not many things cheaper than supposing and laughing; and if
the uniting these two talents can bring a thing into contempt, it
is hard to know where it may end.</p>
<p>To conclude: These considerations may perhaps have some effect
while men are awake; but what arguments shall we use to the
sleeper?&nbsp; What methods shall we take to hold open his
eyes?&nbsp; Will he be moved by considerations of common
civility?&nbsp; We know it is reckoned a point of very bad
manners to sleep in private company, when, perhaps, the tedious
impertinence of many talkers would render it at least as
excusable as the dullest sermon.&nbsp; Do they think it a small
thing to watch four hours at a play, where all virtue and
religion are openly reviled; and can they not watch one half hour
to hear them defended?&nbsp; Is this to deal like a judge (I mean
like a good judge), to listen on one side of the cause and sleep
on the other?&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall add but one word more.&nbsp;
That this indecent sloth is very much owing to that luxury and
excess men usually practise upon this day, by which half the
service thereof is turned to sin; men dividing their time between
God and their bellies, when, after a gluttonous meal, their
senses dozed and stupefied, they retire to God&rsquo;s house to
sleep out the afternoon.&nbsp; Surely, brethren, these things
ought not so to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that hath ears to hear let him hear.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And God give us all, grace to hear and receive His Holy Word to
the salvation of our own souls.</p>
<h2><a name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 393</span>ON
THE WISDOM OF THIS WORLD.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The wisdom of
this world is foolishness with God.&rdquo;&mdash;I <i>Cor</i>.
iii. 19.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is remarkable that about the
time of our Saviour&rsquo;s coming into the world all kinds of
learning flourished to a very great degree, insomuch that nothing
is more frequent in the mouths of many men, even such who pretend
to read and to know, than an extravagant praise and opinion of
the wisdom and virtue of the Gentile sages of those days, and
likewise of those ancient philosophers who went before them,
whose doctrines are left upon record, either by themselves or
other writers.&nbsp; As far as this may be taken for granted, it
may be said that the providence of God brought this about for
several very wise ends and purposes; for it is certain that these
philosophers had been a long time before searching out where to
fix the true happiness of man; and not being able to agree upon
any certainty about it, they could not possibly but conclude, if
they judged impartially, that all their inquiries were in the end
but vain and fruitless, the consequence of which must be not only
an acknowledgment of the weakness of all human wisdom, but
likewise an open passage hereby made for letting in those beams
of light which the glorious sunshine of the Gospel then brought
into the world, by revealing those hidden truths which they had
so long before been labouring to discover, and fixing the general
happiness of mankind beyond all controversy and dispute.&nbsp;
And therefore the providence of God wisely suffered men of deep
genius and learning then to arise, who should search into the
truth of the Gospel now made known, and canvass its doctrines
with all the subtilty and knowledge they were masters of, and in
the end freely acknowledge that to be the true wisdom only
&ldquo;which cometh from above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, to make a further inquiry into the truth of this
observation, I doubt not but there is reason to think that a
great many of those encomiums given to ancient philosophers are
taken upon trust, and by a sort of men who are not very likely to
be at the pains of an inquiry that would employ so much time and
thinking.&nbsp; For the usual ends why men affect this kind of
discourse appear generally to be either out of ostentation, that
they may pass upon the world for persons of great knowledge and
observation, or, what is worse, there are some who highly exalt
the wisdom of those Gentile sages, thereby obliquely to glance at
and traduce Divine revelation, and more especially that of the
Gospel; for the consequence they would have us draw is this: that
since those ancient philosophers rose to a greater pitch of
wisdom and virtue than was ever known among Christians, and all
this purely upon the strength of their own reason and liberty of
thinking; therefore it must follow that either all revelation is
false, or, what is worse, that it has depraved the nature of man,
and left him worse than it found him.</p>
<p>But this high opinion of heathen wisdom is not very ancient in
the world, nor at all countenanced from primitive times.&nbsp;
Our Saviour had but a low esteem of it, as appears by His
treatment of the Pharisees and Sadducees, who followed the
doctrines of Plato and Epicurus.&nbsp; St. Paul likewise, who was
well versed in all the Grecian literature, seems very much to
despise their philosophy, as we find in his writings, cautioning
the Colossians to &ldquo;beware lest any man spoil them through
philosophy and vain deceit;&rdquo; and in another place he
advises Timothy to &ldquo;avoid profane and vain babblings, and
oppositions of science falsely so called;&rdquo; that is, not to
introduce into the Christian doctrine the janglings of those vain
philosophers, which they would pass upon the world for
science.&nbsp; And the reasons he gives are, first, that those
who professed them did err concerning the faith; secondly,
because the knowledge of them did increase ungodliness, vain
babblings being otherwise expounded vanities or empty sounds;
that is, tedious disputes about words, which the philosophers
were always so full of, and which were the natural product of
disputes and dissensions between several sects.</p>
<p>Neither had the primitive fathers any great or good opinion of
the heathen philosophy, as is manifest from several passages in
their writings; so that this vein of affecting to raise the
reputation of those sages so high Is a mode and a vice but of
yesterday, assumed chiefly, as I have said, to disparage revealed
knowledge and the consequences of it among us.</p>
<p>Now, because this is a prejudice which may prevail with some
persons so far as to lessen the influence of the Gospel, and
whereas, therefore, this is an opinion which men of education are
likely to be encountered with when they have produced themselves
into the world, I shall endeavour to show that their preference
of heathen wisdom and virtue before that of the Christian is
every way unjust, and grounded upon ignorance or mistake; in
order to which I shall consider four things:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>First</i>, I shall produce certain points
wherein the wisdom and virtue of all unrevealed philosophy in
general fell short and was very imperfect.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Secondly</i>, I shall show, in several
instances, where some of the most renowned philosophers have been
grossly defective in their lessons of morality.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Thirdly</i>, I shall prove the perfection
of Christian wisdom from the proper characters and marks of
it.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Lastly</i>, I shall show that the great
examples of wisdom and virtue among the heathen wise men were
produced by personal merit, and not influenced by the doctrine of
any sect; whereas, in Christianity, it is quite the contrary.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, I shall produce certain points wherein the
wisdom and virtue of all unrevealed philosophy in general fell
short and was very imperfect.</p>
<p>My design is to persuade men that Christian philosophy is in
all things preferable to heathen wisdom; from which, or its
professors, I shall, however, have no occasion to detract.&nbsp;
They were as wise and as good as it was possible for them to be
under such disadvantages, and would have probably been infinitely
more so with such aids as we enjoy; but our lessons are certainly
much better, however our practices may fall short.</p>
<p>The first point I shall mention is that universal defect which
was in all their schemes, that they could not agree about their
chief good, or wherein to place the happiness of mankind; nor had
any of them a tolerable answer upon this difficulty to satisfy a
reasonable person.&nbsp; For to say, as the most plausible of
them did, &ldquo;That happiness consisted in virtue,&rdquo; was
but vain babbling, and a mere sound of words to amuse others and
themselves; because they were not agreed what this virtue was or
wherein it did consist; and likewise, because several among the
best of them taught quite different things, placing happiness in
health or good fortune, in riches or in honour, where all were
agreed that virtue was not, as I shall have occasion to show when
I speak of their particular tenets.</p>
<p>The second great defect in the Gentile philosophy was that it
wanted some suitable reward proportioned to the better part of
man&mdash;his mind, as an encouragement for his progress in
virtue.&nbsp; The difficulties they met with upon the score of
this default were great, and not to be accounted for; bodily
goods, being only suitable to bodily wants, are no rest at all
for the mind; and if they were, yet are they not the proper
fruits of wisdom and virtue, being equally attainable by the
ignorant and wicked.&nbsp; Now human nature is so constituted
that we can never pursue anything heartily but upon hopes of a
reward.&nbsp; If we run a race, it is in expectation of a prize;
and the greater the prize the faster we run; for an incorruptible
crown, if we understand it and believe it to be such, more than a
corruptible one.&nbsp; But some of the philosophers gave all this
quite another turn, and pretended to refine so far as to call
virtue its own reward, and worthy to be followed only for itself;
whereas, if there be anything in this more than the sound of the
words, it is at least too abstracted to become a universal
influencing principle in the world, and therefore could not be of
general use.</p>
<p>It was the want of assigning some happiness proportioned to
the soul of man that caused many of them, either on the one hand,
to be sour and morose, supercilious and untreatable, or, on the
other, to fall into the vulgar pursuits of common men, to hunt
after greatness and riches, to make their court and to serve
occasions, as Plato did to the younger Dionysius, and Aristotle
to Alexander the Great.&nbsp; So impossible it is for a man who
looks no further than the present world to fix himself long in a
contemplation where the present world has no part; he has no sure
hold, no firm footing; he can never expect to remove the earth he
rests upon while he has no support besides for his feet, but
wants, like Archimedes, some other place whereon to stand.&nbsp;
To talk of bearing pain and grief without any sort of present or
future hope cannot be purely greatness of spirit; there must be a
mixture in it of affectation and an alloy of pride, or perhaps is
wholly counterfeit.</p>
<p>It is true there has been all along in the world a notion of
rewards and punishments in another life, but it seems to have
rather served as an entertainment to poets or as a terror of
children than a settled principle by which men pretended to
govern any of their actions.&nbsp; The last celebrated words of
Socrates, a little before his death, do not seem to reckon or
build much upon any such opinion; and C&aelig;sar made no scruple
to disown it and ridicule it in open senate.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the greatest and wisest of all their philosophers
were never able to give any satisfaction to others and themselves
in their notions of a deity.&nbsp; They were often extremely
gross and absurd in their conceptions, and those who made the
fairest conjectures are such as were generally allowed by the
learned to have seen the system of Moses, if I may so call it,
who was in great reputation at that time in the heathen world, as
we find by Diodorus, Justin, Longinus, and other authors; for the
rest, the wisest among them laid aside all notions after a deity
as a disquisition vain and fruitless, which indeed it was upon
unrevealed principles; and those who ventured to engage too far
fell into incoherence and confusion.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Those among them who had the justest conceptions of
a Divine power, and did also admit a providence, had no notion at
all of entirely relying and depending upon either; they trusted
in themselves for all things, but as for a trust or dependence
upon God, they would not have understood the phrase; it made no
part of the profane style.</p>
<p>Therefore it was that, in all issues and events which they
could not reconcile to their own sentiments of reason and
justice, they were quite disconcerted; they had no retreat, but
upon every blow of adverse fortune, either affected to be
indifferent, or grew sullen and severe, or else yielded and sunk
like other men.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Having now produced certain points wherein the wisdom and
virtue of all unrevealed philosophy fell short and was very
imperfect, I go on, in the second place, to show, in several
instances, where some of the most renowned philosophers have been
grossly defective in their lessons of morality.</p>
<p>Thales, the founder of the Ionic sect, so celebrated for
morality, being asked how a man might bear ill-fortune with
greatest ease, answered, &ldquo;By seeing his enemies in a worse
condition.&rdquo;&nbsp; An answer truly barbarous, unworthy of
human nature, and which included such consequences as must
destroy all society from the world.</p>
<p>Solon lamenting the death of a son, one told him, &ldquo;You
lament in vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I lament, because it is in vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a
plain confession how imperfect all his philosophy was, and that
something was still wanting.&nbsp; He owned that all his wisdom
and morals were useless, and this upon one of the most frequent
accidents in life.&nbsp; How much better could he have learned to
support himself even from David, by his entire dependence upon
God, and that before our Saviour had advanced the notions of
religion to the height and perfection wherewith He hath
instructed His disciples!</p>
<p>Plato himself, with all his refinements, placed happiness in
wisdom, health, good fortune, honour, and riches, and held that
they who enjoyed all these were perfectly happy; which opinion
was indeed unworthy its owner, leaving the wise and good man
wholly at the mercy of uncertain chance, and to be miserable
without resource.</p>
<p>His scholar Aristotle fell more grossly into the same notion,
and plainly affirmed, &ldquo;That virtue, without the goods of
fortune, was not sufficient for happiness, but that a wise man
must be miserable in poverty and sickness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay,
Diogenes himself, from whose pride and singularity one would have
looked for other notions, delivered it as his opinion,
&ldquo;That a poor old man was the most miserable thing in
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeno also and his followers fell into many absurdities, among
which nothing could be greater than that of maintaining all
crimes to be equal; which, instead of making vice hateful,
rendered it as a thing indifferent and familiar to all men.</p>
<p>Lastly, Epicurus had no notion of justice but as it was
profitable; and his placing happiness in pleasure, with all the
advantages he could expound it by, was liable to very great
exception; for although he taught that pleasure did consist in
virtue, yet he did not any way fix or ascertain the boundaries of
virtue, as he ought to have done; by which means he misled his
followers into the greatest vices, making their names to become
odious and scandalous even in the heathen world.</p>
<p>I have produced these few instances from a great many others
to show the imperfection of heathen philosophy, wherein I have
confined myself wholly to their morality.&nbsp; And surely we may
pronounce upon it, in the words of St. James, that &ldquo;This
wisdom descended not from above, but was earthly and
sensual.&rdquo;&nbsp; What if I had produced their absurd notions
about God and the soul?&nbsp; It would then have completed the
character given it by that Apostle, and appeared to have been
devilish too.&nbsp; But it is easy to observe from the nature of
these few particulars that their defects in morals were purely
the flagging and fainting of the mind for want of a support by
revelation from God.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I proceed, therefore, in the <i>third</i> place, to show the
perfection of Christian wisdom from above; and I shall endeavour
to make it appear from those proper characters and marks of it by
the Apostle before mentioned, in the third chapter, and 15th,
16th, and 17th verses.</p>
<p>The words run thus&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly,
sensual, devilish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and
every evil work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then
peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and
good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wisdom from above is first pure.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
purity of the mind and spirit is peculiar to the Gospel.&nbsp;
Our Saviour says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
shall see God.&rdquo;&nbsp; A mind free from all pollution of
lusts shall have a daily vision of God, whereof unrevealed
religion can form no notion.&nbsp; This is it that keeps us
unspotted from the world, and hereby many have been prevailed
upon to live in the practice of all purity, holiness, and
righteousness, far beyond the examples of the most celebrated
philosophers.</p>
<p>It is &ldquo;peaceable, gentle, and easy to be
entreated.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Christian doctrine teacheth us all
those dispositions that make us affable and courteous, gentle and
kind, without any morose leaven of pride or vanity, which entered
into the composition of most heathen schemes: so we are taught to
be meek and lowly.&nbsp; Our Saviour&rsquo;s last legacy was
peace, and He commands us to forgive our offending brother unto
seventy times seven.&nbsp; Christian wisdom is full of mercy and
good works, teaching the height of all moral virtues, of which
the heathens fell infinitely short.&nbsp; Plato indeed (and it is
worth observing) has somewhere a dialogue, or part of one, about
forgiving our enemies, which was perhaps the highest strain ever
reached by man without Divine assistance; yet how little is that
to what our Saviour commands us, &ldquo;To love them that hate
us, to bless them that curse us, and to do good to them that
despitefully use us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christian wisdom is &ldquo;without partiality;&rdquo; it is
not calculated for this or that nation of people, but the whole
race of mankind.&nbsp; Not so the philosophical schemes, which
were narrow and confined, adapted to their peculiar towns,
governments, or sects; but &ldquo;in every nation, he that
feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted with
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, It is &ldquo;without hypocrisy;&rdquo; it appears to
be what it really is; it is all of a piece.&nbsp; By the
doctrines of the Gospel we are so far from being allowed to
publish to the world those virtues we have not, that we are
commanded to hide even from ourselves those we really have, and
not to let our right hand know what our left hand does, unlike
several branches of the heathen wisdom, which pretended to teach
insensibility and indifference, magnanimity and contempt of life,
while at the same time, in other parts, it belied its own
doctrines.</p>
<p>I come now, in the last place, to show that the great examples
of wisdom and virtue among the Grecian sages were produced by
personal merit; and not influenced by the doctrine of any
particular sect, whereas in Christianity it is quite the
contrary.</p>
<p>The two virtues most celebrated by ancient moralists were
fortitude and temperance, as relating to the government of man in
his private capacity, to which their schemes were generally
addressed and confined, and the two instances wherein those
virtues arrived at the greatest height were Socrates and
Cato.&nbsp; But neither these, nor any other virtues possessed by
these two, were at all owing to any lessons or doctrines of a
sect.&nbsp; For Socrates himself was of none at all; and although
Cato was called a Stoic, it was more from a resemblance of
manners in his worst qualities, than that he avowed himself one
of their disciples.&nbsp; The same may be affirmed of many other
great men of antiquity.&nbsp; Whence I infer that those who were
renowned for virtue among them were more obliged to the good
natural dispositions of their own minds than to the doctrines of
any sect they pretended to follow.</p>
<p>On the other side, as the examples of fortitude and patience
among the primitive Christians have been infinitely greater, and
more numerous, so they were altogether the product of their
principles and doctrine, and were such as the same persons,
without those aids, would never have arrived to.&nbsp; Of this
truth most of the Apostles, with many thousand martyrs, are a
cloud of witnesses beyond exception.&nbsp; Having, therefore,
spoken so largely upon the former heads, I shall dwell no longer
upon this.</p>
<p>And if it should here be objected, Why does not Christianity
still produce the same effects? it is easy to answer, first,
that, although the number of pretended Christians be great, yet
that of true believers, in proportion to the other, was never so
small; and it is a true lively faith alone that, by the
assistance of God&rsquo;s grace, can influence our practice.</p>
<p>Secondly, We may answer that Christianity itself has very much
suffered by being blended up with Gentile philosophy.&nbsp; The
Platonic system, first taken into religion, was thought to have
given matter for some early heresies in the Church.&nbsp; When
disputes began to arise, the Peripatetic forms were introduced by
Scotus as best fitted for controversy.&nbsp; And however this may
now have become necessary, it was surely the author of a
litigious vein, which has since occasioned very pernicious
consequences, stopped the progress of Christianity, and been a
great promoter of vice; verifying that sentence given by St.
James, and mentioned before, &ldquo;Where envying and strife is,
there is confusion and every evil work.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the
fatal stop to the Grecians in their progress both of arts and
arms; their wise men were divided under several sects, and their
governments under several commonwealths, all in opposition to
each other, which engaged them in eternal quarrels among
themselves, while they should have been armed against the common
enemy.&nbsp; And I wish we had no other examples, from the like
causes, less foreign or ancient than that.&nbsp; Diogenes said
Socrates was a madman; the disciples of Zeno and Epicurus, nay,
of Plato and Aristotle, were engaged in fierce disputes about the
most insignificant trifles.&nbsp; And if this be the present
language and practice among us Christians no wonder that
Christianity does not still produce the same effects which it did
at first, when it was received and embraced in its utmost purity
and perfection; for such wisdom as this cannot &ldquo;descend
from above,&rdquo; but must be &ldquo;earthly, sensual, devilish,
full of confusion and every evil work,&rdquo; whereas, &ldquo;the
wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy
to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without
partiality, and without hypocrisy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the true
heavenly wisdom, which Christianity only can boast of, and which
the greatest of the heathen wise men could never arrive at.</p>
<p>Now to God the Father, &amp;c.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
